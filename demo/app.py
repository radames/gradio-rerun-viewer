# across multiple workers stay isolated.


# A task can directly log to a binary stream, which is routed to the embedded viewer.
# Incremental chunks are yielded to the viewer using `yield stream.read()`.
#
# This is the preferred way to work with Rerun in Gradio since your data can be immediately and
# incrementally seen by the viewer. Also, there are no ephemeral RRDs to cleanup or manage.
